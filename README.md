#Homework2 - FIND NATIONALITY WEB PAGE

API: https://api.nationalize.io?name=

In this homework, I created a web page that returns the nationality of a person based on their name. I ran the node js in localhost, port 3000. (127.0.0.1:3000)

In the server I render the HTML file, and from HTML I got the css styling and js functionality.

Thank you!
